/// A curated, clean-room gallery of canonical script-graph examples the editor can
/// LOAD onto the canvas (see + edit) and PLAY on Apple's real `RealityKitScripting`
/// runtime, driving the box geometry.
///
/// Every example is built **only** from node types that already exist in the app's
/// node library (`ScriptGraphNodeLibrary`) — parity with RCP 3, no invented nodes —
/// and wires their pins by the faithful `murmur64a` connector hashes (so a loaded
/// example presents exactly the named pins the editor draws, and the canonical
/// compiler resolves them the same way it resolves a real captured graph).
///
/// ## Runs today vs. needs variables
///
/// `runsToday == true` examples are wired so the canonical
/// `CanonicalScriptGraphCompiler` lowers the whole wired path to faithful runtime JS
/// with **no `unsupported` note on that path** — the backing compiler tests assert
/// exactly that. Press ▶ Play and the box moves.
///
/// `runsToday == false` examples need a graph **variable** (an accumulator like
/// `$angle` or `$t`). The variable get/set nodes exist in the library and the
/// example authors + compiles, but the canonical compiler can't yet resolve the
/// variable's *name* (it lives in node settings, not the wire graph), so it emits a
/// placeholder for the variable read/write — the example loads and edits fine, but
/// won't run correctly until variable-name authoring lands. Each says so in its
/// `summary`.
///
/// ## A note on scalar literals
///
/// A few examples want a scalar literal on a `make_vector3` component (e.g. an
/// offset of `0.2`). Scalar literals are a node-*settings* field, not a wire, and
/// neither the editor's literal UI nor the canonical compiler reads them yet, so an
/// unwired component pin lowers to a safe `0` (NOT an `unsupported` note). Where that
/// matters to an example's behavior it is called out honestly in the `summary`.
